# Lucy

Lucy is Gleam's mascot. She's a non-binary star âœ¨

## How to Make a Lucy

The following are general guidelines. Feel free to experiment or adjust them as you see fit.

1. Open the [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) vector image editor ([Basic Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html)).
1. Open the [`lucy-lib.svg`](lucy-lib.svg) provided in this repository (`Ctrl`+`O`).
1. Zoom in until the set of five limbs takes up most of the screen (`+`).
1. Open a new document in another window (`Ctrl`+`N`).
1. Zoom to the same level as the `lucy-lib` window (`+`).
1. Choose the `Pencil` (freehand) tool (`F6`) and configure it as such:
    - `Create regular Bezier path`
    - `smoothing: 45`
    - `shape: From clipboard`
    - `scale: 1.00`
1. Return to the `lucy-lib` window.
1. Choose the `Selector` tool (`F1`).
1. Click to select one of the limbs, then copy it to your clipboard (`Ctrl`+`C`).
1. Return to your new document window.
1. Use the `Pencil` tool to draw a line with your choice of orientation and curvature. If all goes well, the limb you copied will replace your completed line.
1. Undo (`Ctrl`+`Z`) and try again as needed.
1. Use the `Fill and Stroke` settings (`Shift`+`Ctrl`+`F`) to fill the limb with Gleam's charcoal color (`#282828`) and remove any stroke (outline).
1. Return to the `lucy-lib` window.
1. Click to select a different limb, then copy it to your clipboard (`Ctrl`+`C`).
1. Return to your new document window.
1. Draw another limb.
1. Repeat the previous four steps until you've used and drawn all five limbs.
1. Use the `Selector` tool (`F1`) to move and rotate your new Lucy's limbs until you're happy with the result. You can also move a limb aside and try drawing it again if you wish.
1. Save (`Ctrl`+`S`) your new Lucy with a filename formatted like `lucy-{pose}.svg`, then share it with the [Gleam community](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy)!
